## Notes

I had trouble getting the slider to work correctly. It's still a bit buggy as it doesnt update the split value when the slider is changed. I was having trouble
figuring out what setting I had to add in order to have calculateTip() called whenever the slider was changed but I wasn't able to figure that out.
